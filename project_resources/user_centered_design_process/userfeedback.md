###Day 1:

General:
- Rename the tool to encompass more than just EPA
- Document vision for both immediate and historical view of the data to support multiple use cases
- Address IE 9 functionality issues (MVP) and look/feel (not MVP)

Landing page:
- Remove RAD logo, move CSRA logo to bottom right and make it smaller
- About “About this tool” link top right, open new page with content TBD
- In search box, update text to read “Enter address, city, state and/or zipcode

Search results:
- Ensure results exclude international data
- Allow users to export data (not MVP)
- On water contaminants card, make links to specific violation types look “clickable”
- Within water contaminants modal, rename date fields to be something more intuitive
- Add tool tips to define each column header
- Create linkage to substance registry service from contaminant names to allow users to learn more about an individual contaminant 

###Day 2:

General:
- Update placeholder/intro text throughout
Landing Page: 
- Consider allowing users to sign up for notifications on the landing page as well
Air Quality card:
- Need to define chemicals with rollovers: what are they, in English, and why do they matter?
- Need to create rollovers attached to a question icon to tell you more about a card. Those should be pulling from the master “About this site” page.
- Users appreciated groupings by type of card (Air info appears together) 
- Need legend for air quality. Also user was unsure what the dates meant--is that month/year or month/day? Is it projecting data--12/17 appears now but it's 12/16.
- can we center the dates and dots? looks a little off
UV Index: 
- need a legend or scale. Help users understand the "score" ("Is a 2 good? I see it's low, but compared to what?")
Water Quality card:
- list is more important than the map--explore design options that place more prominence on the list. user was also unsure what the map was depicting: is it everything? is it just what I have chosen to expose in the list?

###Day 3:

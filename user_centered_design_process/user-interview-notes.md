####Task 1:

Craig went directly to SDWIS search – “I know Safe drinking water systems”. Clicked on VA on the map. “I know the name of the water system.” Selected County, search. 

Returns list of water systems. Selected a water system. Clicked link for health based violations – “I may not have searched this right – there are violations but I can’t tell what these are. Let me go back, I may have looked in the wrong place.

3rd look – saw message in italics on results page that there were no violations.

I guess I have to look at other systems to see everything that is going on.

####Task 2: 

I would be very interested in getting email or real time alerts if something new is happening in my area.

####Task 1: 

Googled ‘22204 Contaminated drinking water’ – started scanning results. “Maybe this? No, I don’t want a pdf”

Googled water quality by zip code – selected National Drinking water database – ‘is this what I want?’ – it says my water is fine.

####Task 2: 

Googled ‘real time environmental monitoring and notification’ – “is this what I want?” no, this is an abstract.

Googled “notification for environmental issues” – found natural resources and environmental issues magazine – nope.

Asked if interested in notifications – “I hate notifications, not enough time to read everything. I would hear about any issues on the news or Facebook. I might go to EPA to confirm something I hear but would go to EPA through Google.”

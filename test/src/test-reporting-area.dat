12/14/15|12/15/15||EST|1|F|Y|Ann Arbor|MI|42.2754|-83.7308|PM2.5||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, December 14th, 2015 through Friday, December 18th, 2015  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range between Good and low Moderate through the forecast period.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A low pressure area and frontal boundary passing through the region will keep scattered showers in the forecast Monday. Hourly fine particulate early Monday has been generally Good with the exception of some low-end Moderate values in the southeastern portion of the state. The low-end Moderates are likely because of weaker winds earlier in the day ahead of a cold front. The daily fine particulate averages will be mostly Good across the state but a monitor or two in the southeast may end up low-Moderate.  Precipitation ends overnight as the system pulls away and west/northwest winds develop. This flow remains in place Tuesday keeping fine particulate Good. Winds decrease in speed late Tuesday/early Wednesday as a weak high pressure area moves over the region. Early morning temperature inversions could set up causing hourly fine particulate levels to increase into the low-middle Moderate range. However, this will be short-lived as wind speeds pick up by late morning from the south/southeast ahead of the next weather system. Increased winds speeds will keep the atmosphere well-mixed and daily fine particulate averages will generally be Good. This weather system brings precipitation back in the forecast Wednesday as a cold front passes through.  By Thursday, precipitation chances end as cooler/cleaner air moves in on a northwest wind. This flow remains in place through the end of the week and winds will be strong enough to hamper any pollution build-up. Fine particulate will be in the Good range both Thursday and Friday.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended forecast models show surface high pressure sliding to the south, then southeast of Michigan Saturday into Sunday. Winds turn to the southwest and weaken as we move into Sunday. Fine particulate may increase towards the Moderate range early next week. This forecast will be updated Friday to better detail the expected pollution levels for the weekend and early next week.

The good news, atmospheric mixing will help knock the hourly PM10 levels down and end the day with good AQI levels for today. Unfortunately the very cold temperatures will remain for the next couple of days and we will have overnight low temperatures in the mid/upper 20s the next few mornings! An eventual warm up later in the work week will also help morning inversions strengthen which will result in elevated PM2.5 levels (i.e. low moderate) Wednesday through the end of the work week. The PM10 levels will remain in the good AQI category since the majority of the ground surfaces have been stabilized by the recent rains. Ozone levels will remain in the good AQI category due to the continued reduction in daily sunlight and lower sun angle. Forecaster: Scott D.|Pinal County Air Quality Control District

As a result, particle levels will be Good. Wednesday, an upper-level ridge of high pressure will move over northern California, reducing vertical mixing in the atmosphere. In addition, an overnight temperature inversion will trap pollutants near the surface, and light and variable winds will limit pollutant dispersion throughout the day. As a result, particle levels will be high-Moderate. Thursday, the upper-level ridge will strengthen, further limiting atmospheric mixing.
